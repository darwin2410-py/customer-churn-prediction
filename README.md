# customer-churn-prediction


I made a model to predict customer churn using machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. I found out that the best model to use is a model which could yield a high accuracy in both training fase and testing fase. Logistic Regression model yield a 79% accuracy.
